        <p>My sleep schedule is screwed up but hopefully I will be able to fix that soon. I am also slightly irritated at how few calories I am actually consuming. </p>
        <h2>04/05/23 Addlestone 17:00</h2>
        <p>Currently watching some cricket. Unfortunately I didn't get anything done after cooking and washing up. Disappointingly, I didn't manage to regulate my sleep schedule. I guess it was too much to expect to fix it that easily. Hopefully with some mirtazapine, it will be ok. Plan to continue working on my plans while the match is going on and then cook some lamb hearts with rice and vegetables.</p>

        <p>Managed to set up git for this laptop and it felt incredibly good to go into the cmder and type in commands</p>
        <h3>04/05/23 Addlestone 00:18</h3>
        <p>I worked out, did legs and traps. Went to Tesco got some meat. Seemed to have forgotten oat milk so I will have to go tomorrow again. Tidied up my room too so that is a win! Gonna Cook some protein and wash dishes. After that I plan to work on setting out plans for the different projects I have going on.</p>
        <h3>03/05/23 Addlestone 12:27</h3>
        <p>Just played some cricket captain instead, gonna have some cereal while watching the final stages of the LSG innings for CSK vs LSG. Then maybe take a nap. </p>
        <h3>03/05/2023 Addlestone 10:19</h3>
        <p>Just pulled an all nighter because I couldn't sleep. Had 3 Mangoes, which is 2 too many. Pretty pleased with the fact that I managed to get this site up and running quite quickly. Fairly excited about this, hopefully this keeps me accountable! I plan on going to sleep in a while (taking a short nap) and then getting up and continuing with this.</p>
