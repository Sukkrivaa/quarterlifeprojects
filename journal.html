        <p>I worked out, did legs and traps. Went to Tesco got some meat. Seemed to have forgotten oat milk so I will have to go tomorrow again. Tidied up my room too so that is a win! Gonna Cook some protein and wash dishes. After that I plan to work on setting out plans for the different projects I have going on.</p>
        <h3>03/05/23 Addlestone 12:27</h3>
        <p>Just played some cricket captain instead, gonna have some cereal while watching the final stages of the LSG innings for CSK vs LSG. Then maybe take a nap. </p>
        <h3>03/05/2023 Addlestone 10:19</h3>
        <p>Just pulled an all nighter because I couldn't sleep. Had 3 Mangoes, which is 2 too many. Pretty pleased with the fact that I managed to get this site up and running quite quickly. Fairly excited about this, hopefully this keeps me accountable! I plan on going to sleep in a while (taking a short nap) and then getting up and continuing with this.</p>
